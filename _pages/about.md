About
======
I am a Senior Applied Scientist at [AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/), where I develop research that powers the next generation of multimodal foundation models. Check out a couple recent examples [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08431) and [here](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.06324). Earlier this year, we launched [Titan Image Generator](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/#Amazon_Titan_Image_Generator_features), Amazon's first text-to-image foundation model! Before this, I developed the NLP that powers Amazon's physical store for clothing, [Amazon Style](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-reimagines-in-store-shopping-with-amazon-style). I received my PhD from Stanford University under the supervision of [Johan Ugander](http://stanford.edu/~jugander/), where I focused on designing and analyzing algorithms for [preference learning from human feedback](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13826065). My work commonly falls at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Preference Learning.

I interned at [Facebook CDS](https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/) in the Summer of 2020, and helped develop ways to use People You May Know (PYMK) to catch spammers. In the Summer of 2019, I interned at [Stitch Fix](https://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/) where I helped develop numerous approaches to better understand Client and Stylist preferences. Before my graduate work I received a BS in Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Economics from the [University of Wisconsin](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I was advised by [Barry Van Veen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Vanveen_Barry/) and [Robert Blick](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/Faculty/Blick_Robert/). I have also interned at a number of companies in the past, including [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/) and [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/).
