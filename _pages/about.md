About
======
I am a Senior Applied Scientist at [Amazon Style](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=23676409011), where I help develop the NLP that powers Amazon's first-ever physical store for clothing. Before Amazon, I was a PhD Student at Stanford University advised by [Johan Ugander](http://stanford.edu/~jugander/), where I focused on designing and analyzing learning algorithms for discrete choice and recommender systems. My work commonly falls at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Recommender Systems.

I interned at [Facebook CDS](https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/) in the Summer of 2020, and helped develop ways to use People You May Know (PYMK) to catch spammers. In the Summer of 2019, I interned at [Stitch Fix](https://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/) where I helped develop numerous approaches to better understand Client and Stylist preferences. Before my graduate work I received a BS in Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Economics from the [University of Wisconsin](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I was advised by [Barry Van Veen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Vanveen_Barry/) and [Robert Blick](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/Faculty/Blick_Robert/). I have also interned at a number of companies in the past, including [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/) and [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/).
